 *   1: DATA lines and CAL commands go over Ethernet (TCP port PMC_TCP_PORT).
 *      SYSCLK runs at 150 MHz for the 50 MHz RMII clock, and the USB COM
 *      port is off (the two clocks cannot share the PLL).
 *   0: USB COM port (COM3) as before, Ethernet off.
 * Flashing over USB-C with mikroBootloader works the same either way.
